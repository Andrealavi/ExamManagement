            User can add two types of exam:
            <ul>
                <li> Simple exam </li>
                <li> Composed exam </li>
            </ul>

            Composed exam are made of several partial exams, each with its own grade.
            The final grade is computed by making the weighted average of each partial grade.

            By double clicking on an exam entry, the user can modify or remove it. Multiple rows removal is also allowed:
            user has to select the desired rows and click Backspace on the keyboard. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The application presents a filter feature, that allows to filter exam entries by student's name or name of the class.
            Moreover, it is possible to get an histogram with grades frequencies and see the weighted average of all the filtered exams.
